# What is EarthFast?

_<u>EarthFast is the easiest way to host a fully decentralized website controlled by your community.</u>_

What does that really mean?

1. Chain native

    If you have a wallet, you can deploy a site. That means not just individuals and teams, but also DAOs, AI agents can set up hosting using our CLI, dashboard or via Farcaster Frames.

2. Purpose Built

    EarthFast is a hybrid on/off chain solution where the blazing-fast nodes that serve website content are staked on-chain, but operate off chain to serve website content with minimal latency.

3. Decentralized Content Delivery

    Your site loads directly in the browser from the decentralized node network. The only trusted part of the process is DNS and SSL termination, which we're working to decentralize.

# How does it work?

**Browser**

The DNS for an EarthFast site directs the browser to a domain node which responds with either a service worker or proxies requests directly from the decentralized content network if the browser does not support service workers, as is the case with in-app browsers e.g. Telegram.

The browser executes the service worker to render the content or directly renders the content in the case of the proxy.

All this typically happens in a few hundred ms.

**Smart Contracts**

The contracts are the source of truth for projects and store the project's owner wallet, asset bundle url, validation checksum, node reservations and escrow for payments.

The owner wallet can be an EOA or smart contract, and all actions performed by the project are stored in the history for a transparent, auditable log.

**Content Network**

Content in EarthFast is served through a decentralized network of content nodes, optimized for performance and security. Each node is registered and staked onchain with EarthFast's smart contracts.

Nodes run optimized docker containers to serve content, and are capable of handling thousands of user requests per second.

**Domain Node**

The domain node provides SSL termination and responds to the browser's requests. This is currently the only trusted component in EarthFast, and will be eventually made trustless.

Projects have the option to run their own domain node, have one or more third parties run domain nodes on their behalf or use our hosted "domain node as a service" or DNAAS.

The domain node returns a service worker that runs in the browser to directly request site content from the decentralized content network and validate the content response  against the onchain cryptographic signature.

## How do I get started?

EarthFast is open to use by anyone right now! There's two ways to get started, you can create and manage a project by the CLI or Dashboard.

[The Dashboard](https://dashboard.earthfast.com/) is the preferred way to get started on EarthFast. It automates a lot of the blockchain calls, lets you connect a GitHub repo to build on commit, add custom domain and manually upload assets without worrying about the minutiae of formatting asset bundles, creating reservations, etc.

[The CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/earthfast-cli) is local, non-custodial, and gives you direct access to the smart contracts. Docs [here](https://docs.earthfast.com/projects/project-setup).
