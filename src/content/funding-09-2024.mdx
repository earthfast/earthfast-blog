EarthFast, a decentralized web infrastructure protocol, announced today it has raised $1.4 million in pre-seed funding. The round was led by The General Partnership and Nascent, with participation from Kain Warwick (Infinex, Synthetix) via Bodhi Ventures and Roneil Rumburg (Audius).

EarthFast empowers projects to build and host decentralized web applications with ease, offering a scalable, secure and performant alternative to traditional cloud platforms. Its first product is a frontend hosting solution that allows projects to shift responsibility of updating and deploying sites to a DAO, governance contract, or any other on-chain entity.

> "The team's deep expertise in the web3 space, combined with their ability to execute rapidly, positions EarthFast to become a cornerstone of the web3 ecosystem." said Daniel Portillo, Co-Founder of The General Partnership. "The progress they've made is remarkable, and we're excited to continue to support them."

> "EarthFast is tackling one of the most pressing issues in the web3 space," said Dan Elitzer, Co-Founder of Nascent. "We've been searching for a frontend hosting solution that aligns with the core principles of decentralization while delivering the performance and user experience that modern users demand. EarthFast is the missing piece that many in the ecosystem have been eagerly anticipating.”

The crypto industry has long struggled with frontend decentralization, often relying on centralized gateways and compromising on user experience. EarthFast, which originally began as a community project in 2022 called Armada Network, provides a seamless, high-performance alternative to current industry practices. It addresses issues such as content verification, availability, and latency, which have plagued existing solutions.

> ”One day, communities will self-organize, build products, and share them with millions of users on fully decentralized infrastructure with self-sovereign identities." said Dheeraj Manjunath, EarthFast CEO. "Our goal at EarthFast is to build the necessary tools and infrastructure to make this vision a reality, helping to usher in a more decentralized and collaborative web.”
