Learn how to deploy your <strong className="text-brand-blue-medium">frontend applications</strong> to <strong className="text-brand-purple">decentralized networks</strong>.

## Why Decentralized Hosting?

Traditional web hosting relies on centralized servers, making your applications vulnerable to downtime, censorship, and single points of failure. Decentralized hosting offers a more resilient alternative, ensuring your frontend apps remain accessible and truly owned by you.

## Step 1: Getting Started with IPFS

IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data. It's perfect for hosting static frontend applications.

1. Install IPFS Desktop or run an IPFS node
2. Build your frontend application
3. Upload your build folder to IPFS
4. Access your site via IPFS gateway

## Step 2: Permanent Storage with Arweave

While IPFS requires nodes to pin your content, Arweave offers truly permanent storage through its "permaweb":

1. Get some AR tokens
2. Deploy your frontend build using 'arkb' CLI tool
3. Your site is now permanently stored on the blockchain

## Step 3: Enhanced Features

Take your decentralized hosting to the next level:

1. Configure ENS/DNSLink for human-readable domains
2. Implement IPFS/Arweave gateway failover
3. Set up automated deployment pipelines
4. Monitor content availability across the network
