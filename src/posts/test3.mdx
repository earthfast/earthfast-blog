Create a <strong className="text-brand-blue-medium">decentralized notebook app</strong> to add, manage, and organize a <strong className="text-brand-purple">collection of encrypted notes</strong> that you truly own.

## Introduction

Traditional note-taking apps store your data on centralized servers, giving you little control over your information. By building a decentralized alternative, we can ensure your notes remain private, secure, and fully under your control using blockchain technology and IPFS storage.

## Level 1: Basic Note Creation with IPFS

The foundation of our decentralized notebook is storing notes on IPFS. We'll start by creating a simple interface that allows users to write notes and save them to IPFS, generating a unique content hash for each note that serves as its permanent identifier.

Create a form to add new notes and store them on IPFS, then display them in a list using their IPFS hashes.

## Level 2: Authentication and Encryption

To ensure your notes remain private, we'll implement blockchain-based authentication (using MetaMask or similar) and client-side encryption. This way, only you can access and decrypt your notes, even though they're stored on the public IPFS network.

Add wallet connection, note encryption, and a tagging system with encrypted metadata.

## Level 3: Decentralized Search and Linking

Building on our encrypted foundation, we'll implement a local search index and the ability to create connections between notes. All metadata and relationships will be stored on-chain, with the content remaining on IPFS.

Add local search functionality and Roam Research-inspired note linking while maintaining decentralization.

## Toolbox
- IPFS (for decentralized storage)
- Web3.js (for blockchain interaction)
- Lit Protocol (for encryption)
- OrbitDB (for decentralized indexing)
- Fuse.js (for local search)
